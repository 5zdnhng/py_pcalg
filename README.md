# py_pcalg
Build a python version **causal inference model** for Pcalg

For there is no pc algorithm implement in python module. This rep may fill the gap for people who want to explore Graph Model

You can find the pcalg for causal inference in link below:
   https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pcalg


**Usage**

run `debug_trivial()` in `pc.py` to test.

skeleton function fullfilled, now you can try to inference the causal structural with skel.

just run pc!

I will update visualization modules for soon(Updated).
